Our TinyFS implemenation appears to be fully functional. The Single File Driver
demonstrates opening, closing, deleting, reopening, reading, writing, and 
seeking of a single file. The behavior is as expect. 

Similarly, for the Multi File Driver demonstrates opening multiple files at the
same time. It shows how a new file is always assigned the lowest available 
file descriptor. Reading and writing with one file does not affect the status
of other open files. 

The two additional features we added were time stamps and directory listing/renaming.
   1. Renaming a file does exactly what it sounds like: renames a file without 
      changing the contents of the file. Directory listing lists all of the 
      open files in the disk, as well as the file size for each file in bytes.
   2. Time stamps show the created, modified and accessed times for each of 
      the file. In order to demonstrate the functionality sleep() is called. 
      This causes pauses in the execution of the program. The created, modified 
      and access times of a file reflect the elapsed time during the driver.

As far as bugs/limitations. . .
   
   1. There is currently a bug where an invalid offset for tfs_seek() is generated
      sometimes when writing to new files.
